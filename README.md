# Obasa_Ifekitan_Interactive
 a responsive one-page application to showcase an interactive implementation of infographic design.


## Description

The basis of this assignment is to take complex information – statistics, research
results, data comparison, forms, charts, analysis, etc., – and present it in the most
efficient and easily understood way possible. The specific difference between this
form of design and traditional infographics is the dynamic nature of the interactive
information design. In this context the complexity of information can parse both live and
static content from a variety of sources with real-time results. This data could be drawn from
data bases, user inputs, algorithms, etc.,


With the added feature of interactivity, information design can engage users in new
and interesting ways that traditional mediums, both static and dynamic, have been
limited in achieving. The added benefit of vector based design comes with the
inherent flexibility due to the algorithm of that graphic type. All aspects of it can be
targeted and manipulated to any desired outcome.
